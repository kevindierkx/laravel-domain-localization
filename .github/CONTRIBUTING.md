# Contributing

All contributions are **welcome**, [all contributors](https://github.com/kevindierkx/laravel-domain-localization/graphs/contributors) will be fully **credited**.

## Bug Report

We accept bug reports via issues created on [Github](https://github.com/kevindierkx/laravel-domain-localization/issues).

### Prior to submitting your report

- **Always search the issue or pull request list first** - The odds are good that if you've found a problem, someone else has found it, too.

- **Always try the [master branch](https://github.com/kevindierkx/laravel-domain-localization)** - It's possible a reported bug is fixed but, hasn't been tagged yet.

### When submitting your report

- **Open a new bug report for each issue.**

- **Write a clear summary in english** - A good summary should quickly and uniquely identify a bug report. It should explain the problem, not your suggested solution.

- **Be brief, but don't leave any important details out** - Tell us what you did, what you expected to happen, and what happened. Do not forget to mention your PHP version, the OS Platform and the package version you were using.

## Pull Request

We accept contributions via Pull Requests on [Github](https://github.com/kevindierkx/laravel-domain-localization/pull).

- **[PSR-2 Coding Standard](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/)** - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't pass the package coding style test suite.

- **Adding tests** - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the README and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **Breaking changes** - We try to follow semantic versioning. Breaking public APIs randomly is not an option.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please squash them before submitting.

- **Run the test suite** - If you want your PR to be reviewed ASAP please consider running this command before submitting it.

``` bash
$ composer test
```
